- >## Project Summary :-
  > By analyzing a vast dataset of hotel bookings, the project seeks to uncover key factors influencing booking behavior, such as seasonal trends, booking lead times, and popular amenities.
  > The dashboard will provide a real-time overview of booking trends, and customer preferences, and facilitate the identification of areas for improvement and opportunities for growth within the hotel's
  >operations. By leveraging predictive analytics, the project will forecast future booking demands and occupancy rates, resource allocation, and marketing initiatives to maximize revenue
  > and customer satisfaction.
  
  > ## Problem Statement :-
   In the rapidly evolving hospitality industry, there exists a pressing need to leverage techniques to comprehensively analyze hotel booking patterns and customer preferences.
   Moreover, the inability to address factors contributing to booking cancellations impacts overall profitability and hinders the ability to provide a seamless and personalized customer experience.
   To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a comprehensive data analysis framework that can extract meaningful insights from the available booking data.

 > ## Conclusions :-
 > * The vast majority of hotel bookings are made by new guests. Almost no consumers (3.86%) returned.
 > * The customer wants Room A to be reserved the most.
 > * Customers do not wish to make a booking with a pre-deposit.
 > * Customers (80%) favored making a hotel reservation for a short visit.
 > * Only 10% of people require space to park their cars.
 > *  Most visitors are couples.
 > * The inability to assign a reserved room to a customer is not grounds for cancellation.
 > * Booking cancellations are not caused by a longer Lead time.
 > * A city hotel is busier than a resort.
