So, overall booking in a hotel matters. So, each room type belongs to each hotel so wherever customers goes, the hotel will be benefit but Hotels should also look in the factors affecting less preference in some particular room type. So, overall if other room types will also gain popularity then again hotel will be benefitted. So, ultimately hotels will encounters more bookings resulting in much more revenues.\n",

The normal approximation test is suitable for this scenario because it allows us to assess how likely it is to observe the obtained proportion (p_hat) if the true proportion were actually 50%.\n",

        "Direct Binomial Analysis: This test works directly with the binomial distribution, eliminating the need for an approximation like the normal test in Option 1.

        "* City hotels are the most preferred hotel type by the guests. So, we can say that City hotels are the busiest hotel in comparison to the resort hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The average ADR of city hotels is higher as compared to the resort hotels. So, it can be said that these City hotels are generating more revenue than the resort hotels.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The total stay of guests is directly proportional to the adr. So, higher the days of stay, the higher will be ADR and revenue as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The percentage of repeated guests is very low. Only 3.9% people had revisited the hotels. Rest 96.1% were new guests. So, retention rate is much low.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The percentage of required car parking spaces is very low. This means less car parking spaces don't affect the business much. Most of the customers (91.6%) do not require car parking spaces.\n",

        "* Optimal stay length in both the hotel types (City and Resort Hotel) is less than 7 days. Usually people stay for a week. So, after 1 week, the optimal stay length declined drastically.\n",

        "* Most number of bookings have taken place in the month of July and August. July and August are the favourite months of guests to visit different places.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The mostly used distribution channel for booking is 'TA/TO'. 79.1% bookings were made through TA/TO (travel agents/ tour operators).\n",
